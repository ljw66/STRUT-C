# Experimental Data and Code for Our Research  

## Overview  
Due to the involvement of commercial tools in our work, we do not have the rights to open-source all code. In this repository, we provide partial experimental code and datasets from six open-source projects. However, real-world project data, which contain industrial software-related information, cannot be shared.  

## `code`  
The `code` folder includes part of the code used in our experiments, covering:  
- **Dependency analysis algorithms**: Implementations of algorithms used to identify dependencies.  
- **Prompt generation**: Scripts for generating structured prompts for LLMs.  
- **LLM output processing**: Methods for handling and post-processing test cases generated by LLMs.
